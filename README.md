### Reporting a security Issue

If you've found a security related issue in Passbolt, please don't open an issue in GitHub.
Instead contact us at security@passbolt.com. In the spirit of responsible disclosure we ask that the reporter keep the
issue confidential until we announce it.

The passbolt team will take the following actions:
- Try to first reproduce the issue and confirm the vulnerability.
- Acknowledge to the reporter that weâ€™ve received the issue and are working on a fix.
- Get a fix/patch prepared and create associated automated tests.
- Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
- Release new versions of all affected major versions.
- Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement.
- Provide credits in the release announcement to the reporter if they so desire.
