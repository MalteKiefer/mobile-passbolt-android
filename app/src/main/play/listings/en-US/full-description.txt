Based in Luxembourg, passbolt is secure by default. The open-source password manager’s security model follows strict end-to-end encryption principles. For the mobile app, one of the ways this takes shape is the fact that private keys are transferred from browser to app off the wire, through multiple QR codes. 

The app, like the passbolt project, is always evolving - striving to be better and offer users the best experience with the features they need most.
